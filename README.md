# 🏠 Predicting House Prices with Machine Learning: A USA Housing Case Study

Turning data into decisions — a regression-based approach to forecast home values using real-world housing data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **Linear Regression** can be applied to predict housing prices based on socioeconomic and structural factors. Using a clean U.S. housing dataset, I performed **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and regression modeling** to understand and forecast property values.

It serves as a practical, interpretable case study in **supervised learning** for real estate analytics and data science beginners.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Preprocess and clean housing data
* Explore feature relationships with property prices
* Train and evaluate a **Linear Regression** model
* Visualize feature impact and model accuracy

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

Features included:

* 🏘️ **Average Area Income**
* 🏠 **Average House Age**
* 🛏️ **Average Number of Rooms**
* 🧍 **Average Area Population**
* 💲 **Price** (Target)
* 🗺️ **Address** (removed for modeling)

---

## 🔍 Key Steps

* ✅ **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, dropped non-predictive *Address*
* 📊 **EDA**: Visualized income, rooms, and population against price; analyzed distributions
* 🔥 **Correlation Analysis**: Found income & rooms most correlated with price
* 🤖 **Modeling**: Applied **LinearRegression** (Scikit-learn), split data into train/test, built regression model
* 📈 **Evaluation**: R² Score, residual plots, predicted vs actual values

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python, Jupyter Notebook**
* **pandas, numpy** – data handling
* **seaborn, matplotlib** – visualization
* **scikit-learn** – machine learning

---

## 💡 Conclusion

This project highlights the power of **regression modeling** in real estate. It demonstrates how quantitative features influence property values, showcasing both the **interpretability** of Linear Regression and the role of EDA in data-driven decision-making.
